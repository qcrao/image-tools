## Features

   - Available only on mobile devices
   - Click the eye icon (👁️) to open images in a fullscreen modal
   - Perfect for mobile users who can't directly click to zoom
   - Easy-to-use modal with click-outside-to-close functionality

2. **Copy to Clipboard (Desktop Only)**

   - Available only on desktop devices
   - Click the clipboard icon (📋) to copy an image to your clipboard
   - Visual feedback shows when image is successfully copied
   - Quickly reuse images in other applications or notes
   - No need to download and re-upload

## Installation

1. In Roam Research, go to Settings > Roam Depot > Community extensions
2. Search for "Image Tools"
3. Click "Install"

## Usage

The image tools appear in the top-left corner of any image in your Roam database:

- **On Mobile Devices**:

  - **Eye Icon (👁️)**: Opens the image in a fullscreen modal for better viewing

- **On Desktop Devices**:
  - **Clipboard Icon (📋)**: Copies the image to your clipboard (turns to a green checkmark ✓ when successful)

The tools are designed with specific needs in mind:

- Mobile users get easy image zoom functionality
- Desktop users get quick copy capabilities without using the right-click menu

## Troubleshooting

If the image tools don't appear on new images, you can use the "Reinitialize Image Tools" command from the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl + P).
