# Roam Image Tools

Roam Image Tools is a Roam Research extension that adds convenient tools to images, making it easier to interact with images on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

1. **Image Zoom**

   - Click the eye icon (👁️) to open images in a fullscreen modal
   - Perfect for mobile users who can't directly click to zoom
   - Easy-to-use modal with click-outside-to-close functionality

2. **Copy to Clipboard**

   - Click the clipboard icon (📋) to copy an image to your clipboard
   - Quickly reuse images in other applications or notes
   - No need to download and re-upload

3. **Quick Save**

   - Click the save icon (💾) to download the image
   - Save images directly to your device
   - No need to right-click and use the browser menu

## Installation

1. In Roam Research, go to Settings > Roam Depot > Community extensions
2. Search for "Image Tools"
3. Click "Install"

## Usage

The image tools appear in the top-left corner of any image in your Roam database:

- **Eye Icon (👁️)**: Opens the image in a fullscreen modal for better viewing
- **Clipboard Icon (📋)**: Copies the image to your clipboard (identical to the browser's "Copy Image" function)
- **Save Icon (💾)**: Downloads the image to your device (identical to the browser's "Save Image" function)

The tools are especially useful for:

- Mobile users who can't easily zoom in on images
- Anyone who frequently needs to copy or save images without using the right-click menu
- Users who want quick access to common image operations

## Troubleshooting

If the image tools don't appear on new images, you can use the "Reinitialize Image Tools" command from the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl + P).
